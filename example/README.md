##Example
This folder is an example of the output that NewsFlash will produce.  The /data directory is created by NewsFlash to hold tracking instances.  Every time NewsFlash tracks the supplied news sources, it creates a text file in the /data directory to hold the results to use for graphing or reference at a later time.  Inside this example /data directory are results accumulated over the course of a couple days.
