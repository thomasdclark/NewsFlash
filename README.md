#NewsFlash
NewsFlash is a data analysis application that parses the daily articles written by your favorite news sources, calculates the overall positivity/negativity of the individual articles and news sources as a whole, and ranks the news sources from most positive to most negative.  Ideally, NewsFlash is to be used with news sources that are reporting on similar events in order to obtain an objective analysis of equal news content.  The goal of NewsFlash is to prove that some news sources take a more pessimistic approach to reporting the news, which can greatly affect the reader's take away and overall understanding of what actually happened.

##Current Functionality
Accepts a user input URL to an RSS 2.0 news source feed and outputs to the console the name of the news source along with all of the articles that it has written.

##Future Goals
* Complete advertised functionality using command line interface
* Simple GUI design to allow users to choose news sources to parse and analyze
* Automatic daily article retrieval and analysis for saved news sources
* Graphing functionality to see day-to-day changes in positivity rankings
