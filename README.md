#NewsFlash

NewsFlash is a data analysis application that parses the daily articles written by your favorite news sources, calculates the overall positivity/negativity of the individual articles and news sources as a whole, and ranks the news sources from most positive to most negative.  Ideally, NewsFlash is to be used with news sources that are reporting on similar events in order to obtain an objective analysis of equal news content.  The goal of NewsFlash is to prove that some news sources take a more pessimistic approach to reporting the news, which can greatly affect the reader's take away and over understanding of what actually happened.

##Future Goals
* Initial commit with command line functionality
* Simple GUI design to allow users to choose news feeds to parse and analyze
* Automatic daily article retrieval and analysis for saved news sources
* Graphing functionality to see day-to-day changes in positivity rankings
